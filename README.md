Adds support for Amazon's **Kiro IDE** in [Laravel Boost](https://github.com/laravel/boost), integrating the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and AI guidelines specifically designed for Kiro.

## About Kiro IDE

Kiro IDE is an AI-powered integrated development environment from Amazon that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI agents to interact with your Laravel project in a contextualized and efficient manner.

## About Laravel Boost

Laravel Boost accelerates AI-assisted development by providing the essential context and structure that AI needs to generate high-quality, framework-specific Laravel code. This package extends Boost to work seamlessly with Kiro IDE.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Laravel 10.x, 11.x or 12.x
- [Laravel Boost](https://github.com/laravel/boost) ^1.0
- Kiro IDE installed on your system

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require jcf/boost-for-kiro-ide --dev
```

The package automatically registers Kiro IDE with Laravel Boost through Laravel's auto-discovery.

## Usage

### 1. Install Laravel Boost (if not already installed)

If you don't have Laravel Boost installed yet, install it first:

```bash
composer require laravel/boost --dev
php artisan boost:install
```

### 2. Configure Kiro IDE

When running the `php artisan boost:install` command, Kiro IDE will appear as an available option. Select it to automatically configure:

- **MCP Configuration**: Created at `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`
- **AI Guidelines**: Created at `.kiro/steering/laravel-boost.md`

### 3. Activate in Kiro IDE

In Kiro IDE:

1. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Search for "MCP: Reconnect All Servers" and press `Enter`
3. The `laravel-boost` MCP server will be automatically detected and connected

Kiro automatically loads the AI guidelines from `.kiro/steering/laravel-boost.md` to provide contextualized assistance for your Laravel application.

## Created File Structure

After installation, the following files will be created in your Laravel project:

```
.kiro/
├── settings/
│   └── mcp.json           # MCP server configuration
└── steering/
    └── laravel-boost.md   # AI guidelines for Kiro
```

You can add these files to `.gitignore` if desired, as they can be regenerated by running `php artisan boost:install` or `php artisan boost:update`.

## Available MCP Tools

After installation, Kiro will have access to all Laravel Boost MCP tools, including:

- **Application Info**: Information about PHP, Laravel, packages, and Eloquent models
- **Browser Logs**: Browser logs and errors
- **Database Connections**: Database connection inspection
- **Database Query**: Execute database queries
- **Database Schema**: Read database schema
- **Get Config**: Get configuration values
- **Last Error**: Read the last error from logs
- **List Artisan Commands**: List available Artisan commands
- **List Routes**: List application routes
- **Read Log Entries**: Read log entries
- **Search Docs**: Search Laravel documentation
- **Tinker**: Execute arbitrary code in the application context
- And much more...

## Updating Guidelines

To keep your AI guidelines up to date with the latest versions of installed Laravel ecosystem packages, run:

```bash
php artisan boost:update
```

You can also automate this process by adding it to your Composer scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "post-update-cmd": ["@php artisan boost:update --ansi"]
  }
}
```

## Compatibility

This package is designed to be compatible with all versions of Laravel Boost ^1.0. It uses the extension hooks provided by Laravel Boost to register the Kiro code environment.

### Tested Versions

- Laravel Boost: ^1.0
- Laravel: 10.x, 11.x, 12.x
- PHP: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
