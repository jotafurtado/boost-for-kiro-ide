Adds support for Amazon's **Kiro IDE** in [Laravel Boost](https://github.com/laravel/boost), integrating the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and AI guidelines specifically designed for Kiro.

## About Kiro IDE

Kiro IDE is an AI-powered integrated development environment from Amazon that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI agents to interact with your Laravel project in a contextualized and efficient manner.

## About Laravel Boost

Laravel Boost accelerates AI-assisted development by providing the essential context and structure that AI needs to generate high-quality, framework-specific Laravel code. This package extends Boost to work seamlessly with Kiro IDE.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Laravel 10.x, 11.x or 12.x
- [Laravel Boost](https://github.com/laravel/boost) ^1.0
- Kiro IDE installed on your system

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require jcf/boost-for-kiro-ide --dev
```

The package automatically registers Kiro IDE with Laravel Boost through Laravel's auto-discovery.

## Usage

### 1. Install Laravel Boost (if not already installed)

If you don't have Laravel Boost installed yet, install it first:

```bash
composer require laravel/boost --dev
php artisan boost:install
```

### 2. Configure Kiro IDE

When running the `php artisan boost:install` command, Kiro IDE will appear as an available option. Select it to automatically configure:

- **MCP Configuration**: Created at `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`
- **AI Guidelines**: Created at `.kiro/steering/laravel-boost.md`

### 3. Activate in Kiro IDE

In Kiro IDE:

1. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Search for "MCP: Reconnect All Servers" and press `Enter`
3. The `laravel-boost` MCP server will be automatically detected and connected

Kiro automatically loads the AI guidelines from `.kiro/steering/laravel-boost.md` to provide contextualized assistance for your Laravel application.

## Practical Usage Examples

Once configured, you can interact with your Laravel application through Kiro's AI assistant using the MCP tools:

### Example 1: Querying the Database

```
You: "Show me the first 5 users from the database"

Kiro AI: *Uses the database_query MCP tool*
```

The AI will execute a query like `SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5` and display the results.

### Example 2: Listing Routes

```
You: "List all API routes in my application"

Kiro AI: *Uses the list_routes MCP tool*
```

The AI will filter and display all routes with the `api` prefix.

### Example 3: Checking Application Info

```
You: "What version of Laravel am I using and what packages are installed?"

Kiro AI: *Uses the application_info MCP tool*
```

The AI will display PHP version, Laravel version, installed packages, and Eloquent models.

### Example 4: Executing Code with Tinker

```
You: "Count how many published posts exist in the database"

Kiro AI: *Uses the tinker MCP tool*
```

The AI will execute code like `App\Models\Post::where('published', true)->count()` and return the result.

### Example 5: Reading Recent Logs

```
You: "Show me the last error from the logs"

Kiro AI: *Uses the last_error MCP tool*
```

The AI will fetch and display the most recent error entry from your Laravel logs.

### Example 6: Searching Laravel Documentation

```
You: "How do I use Laravel's queue system?"

Kiro AI: *Uses the search_docs MCP tool*
```

The AI will search the official Laravel documentation and provide relevant information about queues.

### Example 7: Inspecting Database Schema

```
You: "What columns does the users table have?"

Kiro AI: *Uses the database_schema MCP tool*
```

The AI will display the complete schema for the `users` table, including column types, indexes, and relationships.

## Created File Structure

After installation, the following files will be created in your Laravel project:

```
.kiro/
├── settings/
│   └── mcp.json           # MCP server configuration
└── steering/
    └── laravel-boost.md   # AI guidelines for Kiro
```

You can add these files to `.gitignore` if desired, as they can be regenerated by running `php artisan boost:install` or `php artisan boost:update`.

## Available MCP Tools

After installation, Kiro will have access to all Laravel Boost MCP tools, including:

- **Application Info**: Information about PHP, Laravel, packages, and Eloquent models
- **Browser Logs**: Browser logs and errors
- **Database Connections**: Database connection inspection
- **Database Query**: Execute database queries
- **Database Schema**: Read database schema
- **Get Config**: Get configuration values
- **Last Error**: Read the last error from logs
- **List Artisan Commands**: List available Artisan commands
- **List Routes**: List application routes
- **Read Log Entries**: Read log entries
- **Search Docs**: Search Laravel documentation
- **Tinker**: Execute arbitrary code in the application context
- And much more...

## Updating Guidelines

To keep your AI guidelines up to date with the latest versions of installed Laravel ecosystem packages, run:

```bash
php artisan boost:update
```

You can also automate this process by adding it to your Composer scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "post-update-cmd": ["@php artisan boost:update --ansi"]
  }
}
```

## Compatibility

This package is designed to be compatible with all versions of Laravel Boost ^1.0. It uses the extension hooks provided by Laravel Boost to register the Kiro code environment.

### Tested Versions

- Laravel Boost: ^1.0
- Laravel: 10.x, 11.x, 12.x
- PHP: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3

## Automatic Detection

The package automatically detects Kiro IDE installations in the following locations:

**macOS:**

- `/Applications/Kiro.app`

**Linux:**

- `/opt/kiro`
- `/usr/local/bin/kiro`
- `~/.local/bin/kiro`

**Windows:**

- `%ProgramFiles%\Kiro`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Kiro`

**Project Detection:**

- Presence of the `.kiro` directory in the project

## Troubleshooting

### Kiro IDE not detected automatically

If Kiro IDE is not detected during `php artisan boost:install`:

1. Verify that Kiro is installed in one of the expected paths (see "Automatic Detection" section above)
2. Run manually: `which kiro` (Linux/macOS) or `where kiro` (Windows) to find the installation path
3. If installed in a custom location, manually create the `.kiro` directory in your project root
4. Re-run `php artisan boost:install` and select Kiro from the list

### MCP Server not connecting

If the MCP server is not connecting in Kiro IDE:

1. Verify that the file `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` was created correctly
2. Check the JSON syntax is valid (use a JSON validator if needed)
3. In Kiro IDE, open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
4. Run "MCP: Reconnect All Servers"
5. Check the MCP logs in Kiro: View > Output > MCP
6. Ensure Laravel Boost MCP server is running: `php artisan boost:status`

### Guidelines not being loaded

The guidelines in `.kiro/steering/laravel-boost.md` should be loaded automatically by Kiro IDE.

If they are not working:

1. Verify the file exists and has read permissions: `ls -la .kiro/steering/`
2. Check the file content is valid Markdown
3. Restart Kiro IDE completely (close all windows)
4. Re-open your Laravel project in Kiro
5. Check Kiro's steering logs for any errors

### Class 'Laravel\Boost\Boost' not found error

If you encounter this error during `composer install` or `composer update`:

This has been fixed in version 1.0.5+. If you're using an older version:

1. Update to the latest version: `composer update jcf/boost-for-kiro-ide`
2. Or, install Laravel Boost first: `composer require laravel/boost --dev`
3. Then install this package: `composer require jcf/boost-for-kiro-ide --dev`

### Laravel Boost commands not available

If `php artisan boost:install` is not found:

1. Ensure Laravel Boost is installed: `composer show laravel/boost`
2. If not installed, run: `composer require laravel/boost --dev`
3. Clear Laravel's cache: `php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear`
4. Verify the command is registered: `php artisan list boost`

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
